1. Market Level
The Booming Development of the Short Video Industry
In recent years, the short video industry has witnessed explosive growth. As a globally renowned short video platform, TikTok (known as Douyin in China) has attracted hundreds of millions of users worldwide with its rich and diverse content and powerful social interaction features. A large number of users browse, create, and share videos on TikTok every day, making it a vast treasure trove of content.
The Increasing Demand for Content Dissemination
With the popularization of short videos, the dissemination and sharing of content have become increasingly important. Whether it is individual users who want to save their favorite videos or enterprises and media institutions that need to obtain high-quality content from TikTok for secondary creation and dissemination, there is a strong demand for convenient download tools.

2. User Level
For individual users, there are many interesting and valuable video contents on TikTok, such as funny skits, food preparation tutorials, and travel landscapes. They hope to save these liked contents to their local devices for easy viewing at any time and sharing with friends. However, the TikTok platform itself does not support batch downloading and watermark removal functions, which brings many inconveniences to users when saving content.
